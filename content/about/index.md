# About me

{{< figure src="about-me.png" title="Presenting advances of my thesis work at the XVIII Argentinian Congress of Acoustics">}}

🧠 I am an Audio DSP and Machine Learning Engineer currently focused on applying artificial intelligence in the embedded audio industry.

👁️ I also possess experience in end-to-end computer vision projects and applying AI in the healthcare sector, particularly for ALS patient analysis and prognosis. 

🗣️ In my Acoustic Engineering thesis project, I am developing a voice cloning system for the Rioplatense Spanish dialect, capable of synthesizing high-quality speech in real time with detailed control over pitch and phoneme duration. 

📚 Additionally, I have teaching experience in engineering and data science subjects, contributing to the development of skills in these areas. 

💡 I am passionate about merging technology with innovative solutions that have a positive impact on society.
